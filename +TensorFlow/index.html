                                            When studying Machine Learning you will come across many different terms such as artificial intelligence,
                                            machine learning, neural network, and deep learning. But what do these terms actually mean and how do they 
                                            relate to each other? <br>
                                            Below we give a brief description of these terms: <br>
                                            <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>- A field of computer science that aims to make computers achieve human-style 
                                            intelligence. There are many approaches to reaching this goal, including machine learning and deep learning. <br>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> A set of related techniques in which computers are trained to perform a 
                                                    particular task rather that by explicitly programming them. 
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Neural Network:</strong> A contruct in Machine Learning inspired by the network of neurons (nerve 
                                                    cells) in the biological brain. Neural networks are a fundamental part of deep learning, and will be covered 
                                                    in this course.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Deep Learning:</strong> A subfield of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural netwoks. Often,
                                                    "machine learning" and "deep learning" are used interchangeably.
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            Machine Learning and Deep Learning also have many subfields, branches, and special techniques. A notable example of this 
                                            diversity is the separation of <strong>Supervised Learning</strong> and <strong>Unsuperivised Learning.</strong><br>
                                            To over simplify - in supervised learning you know what you want to teach the computer. while unsupervised learning is 
                                            about letting the computer figure out what can be learned. Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning,
                                            and will be the focus of this course. <br>
